## Mystique is dead, long live ... ditto?

After 5 years of working on this Synchronet command shell, I have decided to push forward towards an official-ish release and I have decided to change the name. I'm not even a Marvel fan!


Todo:

Move theme files to mods/ditto directory.
Remove all hacky workarounds and just use built in synchronet ways to
    define optional features. 
Don't assume DDMsgReader, etc is installed. Use loadable
Get Ditto header ansi
Convert lastliner to frame.js

Write installation docs
    notes on installation, not official

    Move ditto.ini to ctrl/modopts.d/ (theme settings)
    Set loadable modules
        lastliners
        automsg
